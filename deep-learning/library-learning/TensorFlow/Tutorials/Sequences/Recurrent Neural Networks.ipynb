    "for an introduction to recurrent neural networks and LSTMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will show how to train a recurrent neural network on\n",
    "a challenging task of language modeling. The goal of the problem is to fit a\n",
    "probabilistic model which assigns probabilities to sentences. It does so by\n",
    "predicting next words in a text given a history of previous words. For this\n",
    "purpose we will use the [Penn Tree Bank](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/ldc99t42)\n",
    "(PTB) dataset, which is a popular benchmark for measuring the quality of these\n",
    "models, whilst being small and relatively fast to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language modeling is key to many interesting problems such as speech\n",
    "recognition, machine translation, or image captioning. It is also fun --\n",
    "take a look [here](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this tutorial, we will reproduce the results from\n",

    "([pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.2329.pdf)), which achieves very good quality\n",

    "and gets updated after reading each word. For computational reasons, we will\n",
    "process data in mini-batches of size `batch_size`.  In this example, it is\n",
    "important to note that `current_batch_of_words` does not correspond to a\n",
    "\"sentence\" of words.  Every word in a batch should correspond to a time t.\n",
