    "# Tensors\n",
    "TensorFlow, as the name indicates, is a framework to define and run computations involving tensors. A **tensor** is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a TensorFlow program, the main object you manipulate and pass around is the [tf.Tensor](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor). A [tf.Tensor](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor) object represents a partially defined computation that will eventually produce a value. TensorFlow programs work by first building a graph of [tf.Tensor](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor) objects, detailing how each tensor is computed based on the other available tensors and then by running parts of this graph to achieve the desired results.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Rank\n",
    "The rank of a tf.Tensor object is its number of dimensions. Synonyms for rank include order or degree or n-dimension. Note that rank in TensorFlow is not the same as matrix rank in mathematics. As the following table shows, each rank in TensorFlow corresponds to a different mathematical entity: has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a data type (float32, int32, or string, for example)\n",
    "- a shape\n",
    "\n",
    "Each element in the Tensor has the same data type, and the data type is always known. The shape (that is, the number of dimensions it has and the size of each dimension) might be only partially known. Most operations produce tensors of fully-known shapes if the shapes of their inputs are also fully known, but in some cases it's only possible to find the shape of a tensor at graph execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some types of tensors are special, and these will be covered in other units of the Programmer's guide. The main ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [tf.Variable](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/Variable)\n",
    "- [tf.constant](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/constant)\n",
    "- [tf.placeholder](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/placeholder)\n",
    "- [tf.SparseTensor](https://tensorflow.google.cn/api_docs/python/tf/SparseTensor)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of tf.Variable, the value of a tensor is immutable, which means that in the context of a single execution tensors only have a single value. However, evaluating the same tensor twice can return different values; for example that tensor can be the result of reading data from disk, or generating a random number.\n",
