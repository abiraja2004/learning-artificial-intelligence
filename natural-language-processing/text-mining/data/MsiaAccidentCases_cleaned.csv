Drowning,Employee Drowned In Diving Accident,"A three-person dive team arrived at a hydroelectric power generation plant to  seal off leaks on valves that were thought to be giving excessive water flow.  The team was told by plant operating personnel that the valves were in the  closed position. After the first dive was conducted  the diver reported that  he thought the valves were in the open position. This was verified by the  plant operating personnel. The diver returned to the surface  and the winch  was started to close the large gate valve. The 762-millimeter pad valve was  manually cranked shut  with the operating personnel and the dive team taking  turns on the crank handle. A dive team member was the last person on the  crank  and the team questioned the operating personnel as to the status of the  indicator  which was not indicating fully closed. The operating personnel  stated that the indicator was never correct and directed the divers to close  the valve until it the crank handle could not be turned any more. When the  employees reached that point  the operating personnel informed the dive team  supervisor that there was still a serious leak and that the diver should use  caution. This was relayed to the diver. The supervisor told his diver to take  his time and not take any chances  as they had plenty of time and could figure  out a different approach if this was unsafe. The diver was proceeding down the  stem of the pad valve when he screamed  ""Ahhh  it's got me  it's got me."" The  supervisor tried to raise him on the intercom with no success. The tender  started to pull the umbilical line with assistance of the supervisor  and the  line broke loose. When they reeled in the lifeline  they found that the  connection to the diver's harness was broken. The communications line and air  hose were also broken away from their attach points to the helmet. The gates  were cycled open while awaiting a rescue dive team. When the diver did not  surface  a plan to search for him was implemented by the company with  concurrence of the emergency people on site since they were the most  experienced in the area. Two dives could not locate the missing diver  and the  decision was made to close the valves and complete the sealing so that a lower  chamber entrance hatch could be unbolted and entered by a rescue dive team.  Following this procedure  the rescue dive team recovered the missing diver 12  hours after his lines were broken. He had drowned. There was no tearing of the  wet suit or any physical damage to the helmet. However  there was abrasion on  the brass weights and a bent valve on the helmet indicating the possibility  that the diver was drawn into the pad valve area. The lifeline connector was  still attached with a small amount of rope still entwined on the eyelet. It  appeared that the lifeline did not have a thimble for the polypropylene rope  connection to the main rope. There appeared to have been two wraps of the  polypropylene rope around the 6-millimeter-diameter attachment ring  and the  loose end was woven into the main rope. This is where the break had occurred.  The diver had apparently been sucked into the fully open pad valve and down  the tube."
